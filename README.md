# Getting Started with Ziping Liu's attempt at creating a React App but with Twitter

So in the retailtory dungeon that I am stuck in, in which the Amazonion Juris Priests and Doctors, along with their Chiefs and Vices, have made it hard for me to find things to do. I can't really do much other than stand my ground and not shake against their lack of rule in law. I am unable to do much else because I am then stuck in a state between sectors and so trying to actually attempt a normal life ongoing within sectors is completly impossible. 

How can you when Amazon Legal, turned off your health insurance during your Protected FMLA leave, while sending the FBI agents to your house twice to scare you, not paying you your promisted wages, and pretending you don't even exist anymore? Like let's be real here: if I then went and found another job, which would have happened very easily, I don't have trouble getting hired, dude: I had like 5 internships in College.. Anyways, what would I tell my new employer? How would I file my taxes with the IRS? Like it is just a mess and poeople see it and not only that: 

I'm trying to get medical services done on my body, and have surgeries done, because I'm in state where I need to go on a leave of absence to take action and resolve a serious health condition that affects my ability to function in day to day activities. And then, well, Amazon Legal is like: we don't like him though, he's too wise, and weird. So they turn off my FMLA as if they are the DOL.GOV.

## What are the impliations of that? _Most people would then die_

For me, since I'm not most people, and pretty resilient in some ways, I simply stood my ground, and just stood there. I haven't moved, I've been exactly where I have been in my positions and statements since May. And it's pretty boring, so to pass the time, I just go and try to create a react app out of a downloaded webpage, and the nice part is it is also a way to report my statements as well. But I mainly do it to pass time.

This, twitter.com/timeline/***** page was the hardest mother fucking one. To me reverse engineering this and making it a react app as a way to pass time is like a little puzzle. I'm fucking that sad right now, that's how I spend my life, I know right? So what I usually do is I just go on chrome, and click save web page. And then I see it as an odd puzzle to then return back into a react app, instaead of just plain Javascript and HTML. _I know, what the fuck is the point of that? Well I have NOTHING FUCKING ELSE TO DO. I AM BEING RETALIATING, I CANT REALLY ENJOY REAL LIFE. HOLY FUCK._

But, damn, Twitter is a complicated beast. What the fuck is going on with this site? Why is it so over engineered? Like it's very advanced it how it renders, and loads data, but as imopressive as that is, like these are just tweets though. It's for loading text... 

I could see this being super amazingly amwesome for a site taht displays real-time data as dashboards. But damn twitter, way to overengineer. No it's impressive. I actuallly think it's a very damn good idea. You guys future proofed the shit out of your site. 

Because duh: 20 years from now, we won't be just tweeting text. We will be tweeting God Knows what, 100 years ago poeple tweeted with telegrams. For text, and there were no images and it was not very platform social based. Imagine in 100 years from now, what would poeople be tweeting? Probably entire virtual experiences.

So, yeah, very impressive Twitter, i couldn't figure out how to really replicate your site as a react app reversed from a downloaded page of yours.

I failed. You win.

So, I guess I lose. You may do what you want with me now Twitter. You win. I surrender.

## Can Somone Help Me?

I fucking can't figure out how to get the side nav bar to appear. Can somone fix that? I need wisdom. I fucking hate web development holy fuck.


## Original Source Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` (**Initial dummy Tests have been deleted, it fucks with the build somehow**)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

So there's a commit 03d9141b3b18664e4cbd1121add0a83740c63fb8 is the finalized version without ejecting, so you can go back to that one, because the latest commmited has already run `npm run eject`. Why? Idk, I honestly don't know if it helps or not LOL, yeah half the time when I am web developing I'm like, sure okay I have no idea what that does but it seems legit let's run it and add it in.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
